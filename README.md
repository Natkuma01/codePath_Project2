## Challenges‚ö°Ô∏è

This week, my challenges came from a pretty fundamental place, tied to being new to Xcode and Swift. I was trying to use print statements to debug and understand the output of a function, but no output appeared in the console, no matter what I tried. After about an hour of confusion, I finally realized my mistake: I had written the function, but I hadn't called it anywhere! It‚Äôs a simple error, but it taught me an important lesson about the necessity of calling functions.
